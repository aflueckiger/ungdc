This is an analysis of the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC) from a computational social science perspective.

The  presentation demonstrates the promising opportunities when combining sociological inquiries with methods of Natural language Processing (NLP). The talk was given in the session Computational Social Science at the "39. Kongress der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie, 2018, in Göttingen".

This project builds on the following work:

Alexander Baturo, Niheer Dasandi, and Slava Mikhaylov, "Understanding State Preferences With Text As Data: Introducing the UN General Debate Corpus" Research & Politics, 2017. 

The data in this repository is far cleaner compared to the original data since a lot of OCR errors and some coding errors are corrected. Original data can be found here:

I will publish code, new reviewed data, and further information at a later time.
