This is an analysis of the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC) from a computational social science perspective.

The  presentation demonstrates the promising opportunities when combining sociological inquiries with methods of Natural language Processing (NLP). The talk was given in the session Computational Social Science at the "39. Kongress der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie, 2018, in Göttingen".

This project builds on the following work:

Alexander Baturo, Niheer Dasandi, and Slava Mikhaylov, "Understanding State Preferences With Text As Data: Introducing the UN General Debate Corpus" Research & Politics, 2017. 

For this analysis, I further cleaned the data to get more robust results and allow the application of more sensitive methods. I am happy to share the data. Please get in touch to get the full dataset. The original data can be found here:

I will publish code, new reviewed data, and further information at a later time.
